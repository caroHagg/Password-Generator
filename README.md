# Password-Generator

This website will help you generate a unique password. 
You will be prompted to select a length for your password which it will be a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 128 characters.
Next, you will be ask to select if you want to include upper case, lower case letters, numbers and/or special characters.
At the end you will see your new password on the screen. You will be prompted with messages if your selection is not correct.  
While doing this website I learned new concepts about JavaScript and how to use them in my code.  
Here are the sources I read through : www.w3schools.com, developer.mozilla.org, www.programiz.com, www.tutorialsteacher.com.
